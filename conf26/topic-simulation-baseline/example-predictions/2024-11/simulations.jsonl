Respond only with one valid json.\n\nThe query is: \"eye movement\"\n\nRelevant Document: The reentry hypothesis: linking eye movements to visual perception Cortical organization of vision appears to be divided into perception and action. Models of vision have generally assumed that eye movements serve to select a scene for perception, so action and perception are sequential processes. We suggest a less distinct separation. According to our model, occulomotor areas responsible for planning an eye movement, such as the frontal eye field, influence perception prior to the eye movement. The activity reflecting the planning of an eye movement reenters the ventral pathway and sensitizes all cells within the movement field so the planned action determines perception. We demonstrate the performance of the computational model in a visual search task that demands an eye movement toward a target\n\nNon-Relevant Document: The effect of eye movements on traumatic memories and the susceptibility to misinformation : a partial replication : a thesis presented in partial fulfilment of the requirements for the degree of Master of Arts in Psychology at Massey University, Manawat\u016b, New Zealand The issue of whether certain techniques used in psychotherapy might increase false\r\nmemories is a major source of contention between cognitive and practising\r\npsychologists. Recently, a study by Houben, Otgaar, Merckelbach, and Roelofs (2018)\r\nfound that bilateral eye movements used in Eye Movement Desensitisation and\r\nReprocessing (EMDR) therapy increase susceptibility to misleading information.\r\nEMDR is a popular treatment for posttraumatic stress disorder and is primarily thought\r\nto reduce the vividness and emotional intensity of traumatic memories. Individuals who\r\nundergo EMDR therapy may be more susceptible to misinformation that is\r\ninadvertently introduced by the therapist due to reductions in memory vividness.\r\nDespite strong theoretical links between eye movements and false memories, few\r\nstudies have investigated this effect. The current study addressed this issue by\r\nattempting to replicate the study by Houben et al. (2018). This study also investigated\r\nthe working memory account underlying EMDR by comparing eye movements to an\r\nalternative dual-task. An initial pilot study comprising a reaction time task established\r\nthat attentional breathing taxed working memory most comparably to bilateral eye\r\nmovements. The main study predicted that eye movements would increase susceptibility\r\nto misinformation and that eye movements and attentional breathing would lead to\r\ncomparable reductions in memory vividness and emotionality. 94 students (Mage= 25.74,\r\nSDage= 9.68) were recruited to participate in the study at Massey University, Manawat\u016b,\r\nNew Zealand. Participants viewed a five-minute video depicting a serious car accident.\r\nAfterwards, they were randomly assigned to perform either eye movements, attentional\r\nbreathing, or a control task while simultaneously recalling the car accident. Participants\r\nrated the vividness and emotionality of their memory before and after performing the\r\ntasks. All participants then received misinformation about the video before completing a recognition test. Results indicated that the misinformation effect was not replicated,\r\nwith no effect of eye movements on susceptibility to false memories. Findings also\r\nsuggested that eye movements and attentional breathing were ineffective in reducing the\r\nvividness and emotional intensity of the trauma memory. The present study raises\r\nquestions about the validity of materials and procedures used to instil the\r\nmisinformation effect. Limitations of the study and key areas for improvement are\r\nconsidered for further investigation", "response": {"content": "{\"narrative\":\"A document is relevant if it addresses the role of eye movements in visual perception or action, including models of how saccadic planning or ocular motor signals influence information processing in the visual pathways.

Hence, the prompt detection of such attacks has\na priority in comparison to other malicious threats. Previous works on Android\nmalware detection mainly focused on Machine Learning-oriented approaches that\nwere tailored to identifying malware families, without a clear focus on\nransomware. More specifically, such approaches resorted to complex information\ntypes such as permissions, user-implemented API calls, and native calls.\nHowever, this led to significant drawbacks concerning complexity, resilience\nagainst obfuscation, and explainability. To overcome these issues, in this\npaper, we propose and discuss learning-based detection strategies that rely on\nSystem API information. These techniques leverage the fact that ransomware\nattacks heavily resort to System API to perform their actions, and allow\ndistinguishing between generic malware, ransomware and goodware.\n  We tested three different ways of employing System API information, i.e.,\nthrough packages, classes, and methods, and we compared their performances to\nother, more complex state-of-the-art approaches. The attained results showed\nthat systems based on System API could detect ransomware and generic malware\nwith very good accuracy, comparable to systems that employed more complex\ninformation. Moreover, the proposed systems could accurately detect novel\nsamples in the wild and showed resilience against static obfuscation attempts.\nFinally, to guarantee early on-device detection, we developed and released on\nthe Android platform a complete ransomware and malware detector (R-PackDroid)\nthat employed one of the methodologies proposed in this paper\n\nNon-Relevant Document: Time Efficiency on Computational Performance of PCA, FA and TSVD on Ransomware Detection Ransomware is able to attack and take over access of the targeted user'scomputer. Then the hackers demand a ransom to restore the user's accessrights. Ransomware detection process especially in big data has problems interm of computational processing time or detection speed. Thus, it requires adimensionality reduction method for computational process efficiency. Thisresearch work investigates the efficiency of three dimensionality reductionmethods, i.e.: Principal Component Analysis (PCA), Factor Analysis (FA) andTruncated Singular Value Decomposition (TSVD). Experimental results onCICAndMal2017 dataset show that PCA is the fastest and most significantmethod in the computational process with average detection time of 34.33s.Furthermore, result of accuracy, precision and recall also show that the PCAis superior compared to FA and TSVD", "response": {"content": "{\"description\":\"Research on techniques specifically aimed at identifying ransomware attacks, including feature extraction, machine learning or system\u2010level methods for distinguishing ransomware from benign or other malware and evaluating detection performance.\",\"narrative\":\"Relevant documents propose or evaluate methods tailored to detecting ransomware\u2014e.g., by extracting distinguishing features (API calls, system behavior), applying learning\u2010based classifiers, or building detection systems with reported accuracy, recall, precision, and robustness to obfuscation.

Methods: We selected 22 different case reports of\nneuro-ophthalmic diseases from a publicly available online database. These\ncases included a wide range of chronic and acute diseases that are commonly\nseen by neuro-ophthalmic sub-specialists. We inserted the text from each case\nas a new prompt into both ChatGPT v3.5 and ChatGPT Plus v4.0 and asked for the\nmost probable diagnosis. We then presented the exact information to two\nneuro-ophthalmologists and recorded their diagnoses followed by comparison to\nresponses from both versions of ChatGPT. Results: ChatGPT v3.5, ChatGPT Plus\nv4.0, and the two neuro-ophthalmologists were correct in 13 (59%), 18 (82%), 19\n(86%), and 19 (86%) out of 22 cases, respectively. The agreement between the\nvarious diagnostic sources were as follows: ChatGPT v3.5 and ChatGPT Plus v4.0,\n13 (59%); ChatGPT v3.5 and the first neuro-ophthalmologist, 12 (55%); ChatGPT\nv3.5 and the second neuro-ophthalmologist, 12 (55%); ChatGPT Plus v4.0 and the\nfirst neuro-ophthalmologist, 17 (77%); ChatGPT Plus v4.0 and the second\nneuro-ophthalmologist, 16 (73%); and first and second neuro-ophthalmologists 17\n(17%). Conclusions: The accuracy of ChatGPT v3.5 and ChatGPT Plus v4.0 in\ndiagnosing patients with neuro-ophthalmic diseases was 59% and 82%,\nrespectively. With further development, ChatGPT Plus v4.0 may have potential to\nbe used in clinical care settings to assist clinicians in providing quick,\naccurate diagnoses of patients in neuro-ophthalmology.
