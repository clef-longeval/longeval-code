The frontal cortex and the subcortical areas of the brain play a major role in the control of thought and action. Eye movements are increasingly used in neuropsychological research to explore the executive and sensorimotor functions of such neural networks. This interface links the control of action, at the fundamental levels of neurophysiological and neurochemical processes, with the high-level cognitive operations that underlie visual orienting. Patients with schizophrenia have neurocognitive impairments that can be readily investigated with novel saccadic eye movement paradigms. Animal, human lesion, and neuroimaging studies have identified the cerebral centers that underlie saccadic eye movements. The areas of the prefrontal cortex include the dorsolateral prefrontal cortex, the frontal eye fields, the supplementary eye fields, and the anterior cingulate gyrus. Pathology of saccadic eye movements therefore provides information on the functional status of the underlying neural circuitry in brain disorders such as schizophrenia\n\nNon-Relevant Document: A Low-Dimensional Model of Coordinated Eye and Head Movements Eye and head movement data, were recorded under head fixed and head-free conditions, and compared with theoretical results obtained using a nonlinear model of eye-head coordination. The model explains slow, or pursuit movement correlated closely to target movement, and saccades, or quick phases of eye movement. Eye movement under head-fixed conditions was modeled by an externally forced Duffing equation, whilst properties of head movement are described by a second externally forced Duffing equation with lower eigen frequency. In the more natural, head-free conditions where both eye and head movements are used synergetically to pursue a visual target, the vestibulocular reflex (VOR) is represented by coefficients defining the mutual coupling between these two oscillatory systems. In the present model, the oscillator that models eye movement has an inhibitory influence on head movement; head to eye coupling coefficients are included to model the influence of the VOR mechanism. Individual eye and head movement patterns in different subjects can be adequately modeled by altering the coupling coefficients. In order to adequatcly simulate those changes introduced by microgravity conditions, the coefficients defining eye-head coordination (mutual coupling) must be changed. It may be hypothesized tlmt such changes in the neurovestibular system could introduce the instability in eye-head coordination, which is known to lead to space sickness.Whitehall Foundation (S93-24", "response": {"content": "{\"description\":\"Retrieve scientific documents that investigate eye movements, especially saccadic and pursuit movements, in the context of neural control, cognitive processes, or clinical applications.\",\"narrative\":\"A relevant document examines eye movements as a neurophysiological or neuropsychological phenomenon\u2014e.g., studies of saccadic eye movements, neural circuitry, or clinical implications in disorders such as schizophrenia.

The ransomwarelandscape is growing in sophistication and maturity. The latest developments in ransomware, such as Ransomware as a service (RaaS), have exacerbated the problem by offering would-be criminals ransomware services, lowering the technical barrier to entry. Private and public sector stakeholders are currently investing heavily in ransomware detection. Ransomware detection benefits private businesses and government organizations by reducing the hefty financial cost of a ransomware attack. It is therefore crucial that ransomware detection is accurate and efficient. There are shortcomings in machine learning (ML) models and datasets when working with ransomware detection. Specifically, there is a need for monitoring UDP traffic. One alternative that remains to be properly tested is federated learning. This thesis aims to demonstrate the viability of federated learning as a solution to detect ransomware, by testing speed and accuracy (using metrics such as accuracy, precision, and recall) in a virtual network environment. In addition to the main benefits of federated learning (distributed datasets and privacy), the research will also analyze if federated learning offers performance advantages in Malware detection compared to other machine learning models. The main focus of the research will be analyzing UDP traffic. UDP is not given much attention by organizations since it\\u27s a stateless protocol\n\nNon-Relevant Document: Time Efficiency on Computational Performance of PCA, FA and TSVD on Ransomware Detection Ransomware is able to attack and take over access of the targeted user'scomputer. Then the hackers demand a ransom to restore the user's accessrights. Ransomware detection process especially in big data has problems interm of computational processing time or detection speed. Thus, it requires adimensionality reduction method for computational process efficiency. Thisresearch work investigates the efficiency of three dimensionality reductionmethods, i.e.: Principal Component Analysis (PCA), Factor Analysis (FA) andTruncated Singular Value Decomposition (TSVD). Experimental results onCICAndMal2017 dataset show that PCA is the fastest and most significantmethod in the computational process with average detection time of 34.33s.Furthermore, result of accuracy, precision and recall also show that the PCAis superior compared to FA and TSVD", "response": {"content": "{\"description\":\"Identify documents that focus on the detection of ransomware attacks, especially those proposing, evaluating, or improving ransomware detection techniques (e.g., machine learning or federated learning methods) with attention to detection accuracy, efficiency, and relevant traffic features.\",\"narrative\":\"A document is relevant if it directly addresses the problem of detecting ransomware, presenting or evaluating a detection framework, algorithm, or methodology aimed at identifying ransomware attacks.

Sebagai teknologi kecerdasan buatan  ChatGPT banyak menarik perhatian, dikarenakan ChatGPT mempunyai kemampuan untuk berkomunikasi secara alami, spontan dan lancar antara manusia dan komputer. ChatGPT memiliki kemampuan didalam menerima, mengerti serta menanggapi dalam interaksi verbal pembicaraan manusia dan dapat menjembatani komunikasi  antara komputer dengan manusia. Semakin sering digunakan ChatGPT akan semakin cerdas dikarenakan teknologi ini memiliki kemampuan belajar dari kontaknya dengan manusia. Dalam penerapannya ChatGPT dapat digunakan dalam berbagai aplikasi, sebagai assisten virtual dan dapat menjadi sumber informasi. ChatGPT sebagai teknologi kecerdasan buatan memberikan kolaborasi ke dalam berbagai sektor industri, layanan pelanggan, layanan keuangan dan lain sebagainya. Teknologi ChatGPT menjanjikan peningkatan dalam memecahkan masalah, memungkinkan terjadinya komunikasi yang lancar antara komputer dan manusia.\n\nKata Kunci: ChatGPT; Kecerdasan Buatan; Komunikasi; Teknologi\n\nNon-Relevant Document: When ChatGPT is gone: Creativity reverts and homogeneity persists ChatGPT has been evidenced to enhance human performance in creative tasks.\nYet, it is still unclear if this boosting effect sustains with and without\nChatGPT. In a pre-registered seven-day lab experiment and a follow-up survey\nafter 30 days of experiment completion, we examined the impacts of ChatGPT\npresence and absence on sustained creativity using a text dataset of 3302\ncreative ideas and 427 creative solutions from 61 college students.\nParticipants in the treatment group used ChatGPT in creative tasks, while those\nin the control group completed the tasks by themselves. The findings show that\nalthough the boosting effect of ChatGPT was consistently observed over a\nfive-day creative journey, human creative performance reverted to baseline when\nChatGPT was down on the 7th and the 30th day. More critically, the use of\nChatGPT in creative tasks resulted in increasingly homogenized contents, and\nthis homogenization effect persisted even when ChatGPT was absence. These\nfindings pose a challenge to the prevailing argument that ChatGPT can enhance\nhuman creativity. In fact, generative AI like ChatGPT lends to human with a\ntemporary rise in creative performance but boxes human creative capability in\nthe long run, highlighting the imperative for cautious generative AI\nintegration in creative endeavors.Comment: 30pages,6figure", "response": {"content": "{\"narrative\":\"A relevant document should provide information about ChatGPT as an artificial intelligence communication technology, including its capabilities, underlying mechanisms, applications in human\u2013computer interaction, and potential use cases across industries.
